About the project:
In an effort to improve myself as a programmer and game designer, I've taken some core concepts and unused artwork to put together a web-based single player game.
In a kind of minimalist effort, I've decided to write the game using entirely HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript.  Enjoy :) 

Still very much in ALPHA

How to get started:

*Download ZIP file
*Unzip
*Open Folder and Open the "Tribes" page with your favorite browser (Looks best on Chrome IMO)
*Intuit

Within, there is a document titled "PLAYTESTING REVIEW SHEET".  Use this if you would be so kind.

Seriously, if you take the time to playtest this and give me some feedback, you are awesome.  Thanks a bunch.
